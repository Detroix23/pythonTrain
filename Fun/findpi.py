FIND THE VALOR OF PI
    This program will compute 2 n sides regular polygone one inside a 1 radius circle and one outside and make it along more and more precise.
We know that pi = A / 2 for a  r = 1 circle that will be neared by the polygons.

    A in regular polygone is defined by p * a / 2, were p is the perimeter and a the apothem (distance from the center
of the polygone and the middle of a side) were a0 is the point on the side.
